factorial_3_ways
================

Patches 4* different solutions for factorials onto Fixnum. 

I get asked to calculate factorials in interviews as an example of recursion all the time, so here you go.

Can we talk about how I solve the real problems facing your product or business now?

(\* I know, I know... I originally only thought of doing 3 ways, and someone on Twitter pointed out ```Math::gamma```...)
